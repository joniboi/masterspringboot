== CXF WebService Proxy example

=== Introduction

This is a modified version of the CXF WebService Proxy Example from Camel distribution (https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/master/examples/camel-example-cxf-proxy)

Instead of using a Camel proxy as target endpoint, we use a JAX-WS Web service which is deployed in a Java EE Container.

=== Run

Deploy at first the targetWS project.

The proxied webservice should be located at: http://localhost:8080/targetWS/ReportIncidentEndpointService

....
http://localhost:8080/camel-example-cxf-proxy/webservices/incident
....

Run the test with:

....
mvn clean install
....
